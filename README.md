This project uses various resizing and hashing algorithms to convert images into 64-bit hashes, and can compare image similarities with a target image.

## Usage

"ImageFingerprint.m" uses the other functions to execute appropriate resizing and hashing algorithms, which can then be used by "FingerprintCollection.m" and "RankSimiliarity.m" to sort images by similarity to a target image.
